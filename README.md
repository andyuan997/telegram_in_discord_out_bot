# Project Overview: Integrating Telegram and Discord Bots for Message Relay
This project involves creating a seamless integration between a Telegram bot and a Discord bot to relay messages from a Telegram group to a Discord channel. The primary objective is to capture messages from a specified Telegram group and automatically post them to a designated Discord channel.

Key Components:
Telegram Bot:

Developed using the python-telegram-bot library.
Configured to listen to messages in a specific Telegram group.
Group Privacy mode disabled via BotFather to allow the bot to access all messages in the group.
Captured messages are written to a file (telegram_messages.txt) for Discord bot to access.
Discord Bot:

Built using the discord.py library, operating on an asynchronous framework.
Regularly checks and reads new entries from telegram_messages.txt.
Posts the contents from the Telegram group to a specified Discord channel.
Implements an asynchronous loop to continuously check for new messages without blocking.
Implementation Details:
The Telegram bot uses a handler function (handle_message) to process and store incoming messages from the Telegram group.
The Discord bot runs a continuous loop (send_telegram_messages) to monitor and read the telegram_messages.txt file, relaying any new messages to the Discord channel.
Both bots are run in separate threads to prevent blocking operations and ensure simultaneous operation.
Pythonâ€™s threading module is utilized to manage concurrent execution of both bots.
Challenges and Considerations:
Ensuring non-blocking behavior while handling asynchronous tasks in Discord bot.
Regular error handling and file management for smooth operation.
Maintaining privacy and compliance with data protection regulations when relaying messages between platforms.
Continuous testing and debugging to ensure reliable performance.
Conclusion:
This project effectively bridges communication between Telegram and Discord, allowing messages from a Telegram group to be automatically relayed to a Discord channel. It showcases the integration of different APIs and the handling of asynchronous and synchronous operations in Python.
